         <div class="entrybody"><p><img src="/images/sadioe.png" title="NOT MY WIFE&#39;S NAME!" alt="NOT MY WIFE&#39;S NAME!" /></p>
<p>When I finally received my credit card after spending an hour spelling every other identifier I had, from my mother&#8217;s maiden name to my email address to my <span class="caps">SSN</span>,<br />
I was really frustrated to see the cards come in with the wrong name and a facetious first name.</p>
<p>I could easily tell my French accent and the bad quality of the line were to blame for those results.</p>
<p>Determined to get this right, I called back from a better spot in a silent room. This time, the cards came in ok &#8211; but my email address got in mangled.</p>
<p>I decided to look into phonetics to spell my name correctly, and being lazy, I looked at how to <em>never</em> have to think about it again.</p>
<p>I took up the say command line from Mac. It tells my name fine, and the -o option outputs a aiff file for it that I could convert back to wav easily.</p>
<p>That solves the French accent issue. But I wanted to make double sure the guy on the other end of the line would get this right.</p>
<p>Next up, I took the nato alphabet and outputted each letter into a separate file. I converted all files to wav.</p>
<h1>Bringing it on the interwebs</h1>
<p>I created a simple html file that went like this:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1359555.js"> </script><p>The html loads up all wav files using the audio tags, and you play them in the order given by the string you enter in the text input.<br />
The catch in there &#8211; and you see the code trying desperately to make up for it &#8211; is that the play() method of the audio tag is triggering playing, but returns right away. It&#8217;s difficult to catch when the feedback is completed (I didn&#8217;t find a way to register an event handler).</p>
<p>So the code is doing a dodgy thing, it&#8217;s waiting the length of the sound, plus an extra 200 milliseconds, then plays the next letter.<br />
If there&#8217;s a way to listen to the feedback of the audio tag, I would definitely love feedback!</p>
<h1>Server-side ruby</h1>
<p>So the next best thing to try, put Ruby to work and see how it could combine the sounds to stream them out.</p>
<p>I stumbled into this <a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/2010-10-14-Fun-with-wav/">most excellent blog post</a> that deals with <span class="caps">WAV</span>. The goal of the author was to analyze wav files ; it mentioned how to decompose the binary format of a wav file, and the last piece in Ruby showed how to use unpack to read a wav file with a one-liner.</p>
<p><code>data.unpack 'Z4 i Z8 i s s i i s s Z4 i s*'</code></p>
<p>I took this Ruby for a spin and I managed to read my wav files and even <em>combine</em> them on the fly.</p>
<p>I put together some minimal code to load all the sounds available in memory, then combine them into the order dictated by the sentence required.</p>
<p>By placing it behind a sinatra app, it should be easy to serve sounds based on strings.</p>
<p>The code is licensed under <span class="caps">MIT</span> license, available on <a href="https://github.com/atoulme/spell">github</a>.</p>
<p>Being a week-end rambling, the code comes with no tests, miss support for numbers, and god forbid you use a multi-byte character!</p>
<p>Please feel free to fork it and have fun out of it.</p></div>
