  Thanks a lot Assaf.
  
  I had a hard time having this work, even after you tipped me off today.
  
  I got the feed read by Google Reader by adding this to my code:
  
  render :action => :rss, :content_type => 'application/rss+xml'
  
  and that did the trick.

  Note that OSGi only supports 3 numeric identifiers; the 4th one is textual. So if you have 1.2.3.10, that's less than 1.2.3.4. 
  
  Bottom line: only use 3 numeric identifiers, and start the 4th with an alphabetic, even if you're going to include numeric/date version information there to make it clear it's not numeric.

  Agreed -- use something alphabetic for the 4th part. However, nothing stops you from doing something like 1.0.0.v200706251234, which not only adds more information (a datestamp) than 1.0.0.foo, but also guarantees that integration builds in a branch will be able to install on top of older ones (and the Update Manager wizard will respect that too).
  
  I think all the bugs around use of "_" in qualifiers have been squashed by now, but just in case I recommend avoiding the use of underscores in favour of dashes, thus: 1.0.0.v200706251234-something-else-useful-here.

  I really like the idea of being able to customise the colours via CSS. I can't say I share your particular choice of colours, but I've argued that Eclipse should be able to handle a global colouring for IDEs based on what the user wants, rather than what the developer of the IDE wants.
  
  You should definitely file this as a suggestion into https://bugs.eclipse.org for consideration into the generic IDE project.

  Alex,
  
  regarding my choice of colors, I still have to refine them (a lot), for now I want to keep on posting content and I'll update them.
  
  The Eclipse syntax coloring is something that could certainly be achieved much in the same way the Ruby tokenizer works.
  
  From what I remember, text editors may have portions of text recognized in the same way.
  
  So maybe a new extension point ? I'll file a bug and we can continue the discussion there.

  Actually, using StringBuffer is bad for performance. This old myth is from Java 1.1 days when the compiler did insane things when concatenating strings.
  
  Starting from version 1.2, the compiler generates the code above internally, so you win nothing but loose code readability.
  
  With versions 5, the compiler is using StringBuilder which is much faster than StringBuffer because it's not synchronized, so this "enhancement" actually harms performance.
  
  Another one chalked up for "futile/harmful optimization attempt" :-)

  Agree that your solution looks OK. However, I must express a bit of concern with the quick fix listed in the Eclipse M4 notes. There is something which already does this - it is called a compiler - and it does a much better job. For example if you convert string concatenation to StringBuffer calls on JDK 5+ your code will actually be SLOWER. This is due to the fact that the JDK 5+ code knows about StringBuilder (basically non-synchronized StringBuffer - specifically for these localized examples).
  
  Again, I agree that your solution works well for code that may be internationalized but I just thought I would include a quick comment to make sure no one fell for the old always use StringBuffer myth.
  
  
  NOTE: there is a case to use StringBuffer when you are streaming - ie, concatenating in a loop.

  Hi,
  
  >I know using StringBuffers is better for performance. 
  Thats wrong (it was right in Java 1.0)
  
  It is the compiler's task to make this optimization. And indeed, the Java 1.5 compiler uses StringBuffers.
  Since Java 6, the compiler uses StringBuilder if possible, which has an even better performance. This better performance can only be achieved, if there is NO explicit reference to StringBuffer.
  
  So using StringBuffer in this case is a really bad idea that prevents performance optimizations. And you're right, it makes the code less readable.
  
  Cheers, Gerd

  Tom, even if you are not, at some point you'll need to internationalize your product. In that case, you will need to be able to place the bindings in the string in different places, depending on the language.
  
  Aaron, this is a valid point! I had confused the two. I'll update the blog post and will open a bug.

  No . . . you'd better stick with acronym for now.
  
  1. HTML 5 isn't a standard yet.
  
  2. XHTML still supports the acronym tag.
  
  3. The abbr tag is not supported by Internet Explorer.
  
  Also . . . make sure your CSS provides styling for the acronym tag to give it that underline, if you want everyone to see the underline.  While Firefox automatically styles acronym tags that way, that styling is not part of the HTML/XHTML standard, and IE doesn't provide any default styling for the acronym tag.  This means that text in an acronym tag in IE doesn't automatically render any differently than other text, and this behavior is actually standards compliant.
  
  So . . . to summarize:
  
  Use acronym instead of abbr for now, because IE doesn't support abbr.
  
  Make sure your site's CSS includes styling for the acronym tag so that acronyms will stand out from the surrounding text.

  IE 6 will show the abbr tag, just not the tooltip.  IE 7 fixes that bug.  So look at your stats and decide if you even care.
  
  Seeing that IE 6 is diminishing, I would not change the content to suite IE 6, maybe resort to a PHP/JavaScript hack to make abbr behave like acronym.  But on my blog IE 6 usage is low and dropping steadily, that I don't care enough to hack the template.  If I don't care to hack the template, I definitely don't care to create the wrong content.

  Every single page on eclipse.org has a "Legal" link on the top right corner and a "Terms of Use" link on the bottom left corner. Either of those links will get you right to the EPL.
  
  Why not link to the EPL you ask? Because the way you give/receive content on eclipse.org is actually via the "Licenses" section in the Terms of Use. So legally speaking (IANAL, TINLA), it is more accurate to refer people to the terms of use.

  I like Git.
  
  But it doesn't work as well under Windows as it might.  And it doesn't have a mature Eclipse plugin.
  
  Mercurial has both of these things.
  
  However, it doesn't front-end another existing repository as nicely as GIT.
  
  So here's how I see things:
  
  If you want to front-end another repository (CVS or SVN), and don't care about Eclipse integration, Git's your tool.
  
  If you want an actual replacement for CVS or SVN, Mercurial looks like the better choice right now due to the better Windows support and having a decent Eclipse plugin.

content: I think a GIT repo would be great. Not only does it help developers, it also helps those who would like to patch Eclipse because of bugs that won't/can't be fixed in the main trunk. I've submitted a few patches which will never see the light of day because (in their opinion) it does the wrong thing. Forking Eclipse is too much high maintenance because of a single bugfix, but having a GIT repo might make it easier to keep up-to-date with the main tree whilst still permitting custom bugfixes for those that can't persuade the Eclipse team to adopt them.

  I heard rumors though that Egit wasn't ready for prime time. But clearly the momentum in the open source community is behind git and I think it even offers great support for the forking/merging that we need to do commercially to support Eclipse based products that are delivered on different timelines than Eclipse.
  
  Thanks for pointing out the bug. I'll definitely throw my support behind this.

  There is a huge gaping hole in the community for something that will build update sites headlessly. We've spend more than 3 developer-months getting something that works based on PDE Build, but it is hacked together and still does not handle some things well. If you could include Update Site building in your scope, that would be a great benefit to the community.
  Also, running plugin tests (JUnit) seems to be a common need; PDE Build sort-of supports it, but not for JUnit4, which is simply ridiculous if you ask me. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=153429

  PDE Build is the right way and should always be preferred because it is in its mandate to support building all the runtime artifacts of eclipse (features, plugins, products, etc.). The releng script is just a layering over PDE that takes care of the complete SDK build and Buckminster also eventually calls PDE / PDE Build.
  Consequently recommending people to use other technologies is fine. However potential users have to be made aware that by doing this they are buying out of the evolutions of the build technology that matches the Runtime environment (for example support for Execution Environment, or p2 metadata generation integration, ...).

  The feature that creates what we call problem method and problem types is not specific to the Eclipse batch compiler. This is more for the Eclipse compiler.
  The batch compiler is the Eclipse compiler used in a batch environment. So you need to set up the command line properly: classpath, ext dirs, warning level, debug options,...
  If you want to get problem types and methods from a batch compilation, you need a specific command line argument.
  If you grab the jar from the Eclipse download page, you get an executable jar that starts the batch compiler. It can be used for apt compilation (JDK6) as well.
  
  The jar contains all the classes required to call the Eclipse compiler in a batch environment. For the features provided by the batch compiler, they are pretty much the same for the Eclipse compiler within Eclipse.

content: Olivier, I know that much. I'm interested into having an exhaustive list of differences between javac and ecj, and see how much of it supports OSGi (are calls to packages not exposed with Export-Package detected ?).

  Antoine, ECJ has no idea about OSGi or anything. It's a straight up Java compiler that's fast.
  
  On top of ECJ, JDT provides the ability to set access rules which are used by projected like PDE so you get warnings when you use classes that are internal or not exposed via Export-Package. 
  
  I hope that helps.

  Antoine> setting the non-externalized string flag as an error when compiling
  If a project is meant to be internationalised, *shouldn't* a non-externalised string should be an error?  
  
  Chris> PDE also have a setting for this...
  I didn't know about that one, thanks Chris!

  Hey Sean, well I wanted to be nice. I think the level of error should be raised depending on the phase of development you are in.
  
  If you need to externalize before you can run your code, you are doomed to failure. You also may want to avoid externalizing the code for the tests.

  True and true.  Shouldn't force the developer to externalise strings (in the code under test) before running unit tests, for instance.
  
  However, I think it's reasonable to expect externalised strings before checking code in.  (And the wizards (or quick-fix) make it pretty easy to "ignore" non-externalised strings in test code, in bulk.)

  The ugly truth, at least from my own experience, is that some manual testing is required and that requirements themselves change over time as we discover more of the solution. Also, with CVS, you have no choice but to check-in, while with Git you can commit changes locally every so often, so you keep your focus. I hate having modified files hanging around on my local copy.
  
  So we tend to have I-builds provided to QA that aren't externalized. Externalization is an effort that requires a lot of time from devs, and we are ready to commit to that effort when the code is mature.
  
  It all depends on the development process of the company you work for I suppose.

  Okay, that makes sense.  Externalisation can be non-trivial, especially when trying to choose good keys in the resource bundles.  
  
  But I still like the idea of NON-NLS sledgehammers in RC builds.   ;-)

content: Hi Fernando, BPP stands for Business Process Platform. We want to not only address BPM, but also surround it with enough applications and components that it becomes a platform. The XMPP server connection is one aspect, but you should also look at our BAM, our Business Rules Engine, our Database Connector, etc.

  Well, it's got worse I think. Eventually, you could log in, and every time you have a recurring question, add a command to KOS-MOS to make it easy for rcjsuen and others like me to reply automatically.

  I used to log on to it regularly, but I found that I was constantly swamped with questions.  And not particularly good ones.  95% of the tiem it was issues with GCJ screwing up Eclipse, or general "I don't know how to create C programs properly" issues that had nothing to do with CDT itself.  Dealing with all the people with poor English was an issue at times too.
  
  If the signal to noise ratio were better, I'd log on more probably, but I found it was taking too much away from my productivity, for not a lot of good use of my time.

  Better to have an #eclipse-cdt channel, and then add a command to KOS-MOS that just replies "go to #eclipse-cdt" that can be invoked when someone asks a pertinent CDT question.
  
  Specialization is the order of the day, methinks.

  That'd be cool. But for how many questions appearing on IRC that'd be useful? Who'd decide to send a post? Who'd figure in post's sender field?
  Maybe better personally redirect questioner to newsgroup? If he won't go there, then his question wasn't worth posting.

  But Ralph, my CEO has a big attention deficit disorder.
  
  So sitting down all day to listen to stuff he has access to through analysts reports, our lawyers, and a couple of lunches with innovators is not good enough, in my humble opinion, to retain his attention.
