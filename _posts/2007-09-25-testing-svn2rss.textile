title: Testing svn2rss
---

So my latest <a href="http://www.lunar-ocean.com/blog/subversion-commits/">cool app</a> is asking Subversion the latest changes over the repository.

It pretty much does this:

<pre>
svn log #{your_url} --limit #{when_you_d_like_to_stop}
</pre>

Then, for every revision, it runs a diff:

<pre>
svn diff #{rev1}:#{rev2}
</pre>

After playing around for some time with all those commands, my advice is to run svn2rss with Subversion 1.4, as my tests were taking more than 2 minutes to complete.
