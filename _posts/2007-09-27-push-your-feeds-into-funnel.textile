title: Push your feeds into Funnel
---

I have continued my <a href="http://www.lunar-ocean.com/blog/playing-with-the-rss-and-atom-ruby-libraries/">experiment</a> with the RSS libs a bit, and have built a first prototype that I call <a href="http://funnel.rubyforge.org/">Funnel</a>.

Funnel takes the feeds declared in the feeds table.

In a separate thread, it runs a script that looks at the feed, and if there is a new item or an item that looks like it is updated, it runs a filter on it.

The filter is completely extensible, so that I can add antispam measures later like I did <a href="http://www.lunar-ocean.com/blog/integrating-akismet-with-joomlaboard-forum/">here</a>.

Once the item is accepted, it is picked up by the feed when building it using <a href="http://builder.rubyforge.org">Builder</a>.


<style type='text/css'>
 #mpledge-widget-1 a:hover { filter: alpha(opacity=85); opacity: 0.85; }
 #mpledge-widget-1 img { border: none; }
</style>
<div id='mpledge-widget-1' project='funnel' site='http://micropledge.com/'>
 <a href='http://micropledge.com/projects/funnel?do=pledge'>
  <img src='http://micropledge.com/projects/funnel/widget-1-image.png' alt='Support this project with microPledge' width='177' height='75' />

 </a>
</div>
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://static.micropledge.com/widgets.js'>
</script>

_I fund this project with Micropledge.  Micropledge is a really cool website to get your open source projects funded. <a href="http://mycropledge.com">Check it out</a>!_

At this point, I achieved my primary goal but have new  issues I need to deal with.

<ul>
	<li>I want to record the feed optionally. I want to make it possible for the user to record completely the items in the items table, so that he does not have to bother about them.</li>
	<li>I use Rails. While this gives a nice frame to my application, it is clearly overkill for some uses of Funnel. I think I should make it available in different little gems, and the core gem would provide pretty much as simple as <a href="http://svn2rss.rubyforge.org">Svn2Rss</a> is.</li>
	<li>The feed is not cached. It is currently recreated every time someone asks for it. Like Svn2Rss, I need to create an asynchronous way to output it.
</ul>

If I have those core components working, I can easily create an administration interface and a UI to show my feed.
