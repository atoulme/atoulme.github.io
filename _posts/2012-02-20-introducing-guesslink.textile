title: Introducing Guesslink
---

I worked on this pet project for just a little while taking care of our new family addition, Joseph! 

Based on a Rails architecture and deployed on heroku, "Guess Link":http://www.guesslink.net is a simple URL shortener that protects your link with a question and password of your choosing. I used "Twitter's bootstrap":http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap to create the look and feel quickly.

It's useful when sharing a link to your photo albums, or that new website you've been brewing.

I plan on implementing a REST API for it, and use it in other creations going forward.

I welcome any feedback on the site, the intent and the flaws :)
