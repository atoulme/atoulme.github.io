title: "Bug 308732: Gauge interest over a Languages TLP"
---

After our discussion during the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Architecture_Council/Meetings/April_8_2010">Arch council meeting</a> last week, I opened bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=308732">308732</a>:

bq. This bug aims at gauging interest over a languages TLP. The Architecture
Council debated of the current state and layout of the eclipse projects. I
personally would find interesting - and would be ready to help and support -
the idea that we should gather all projects that deal with languages, as in
programmation languages together.

I recently heard how the JSDT project was reusing JDT. I also see more projects
maturing or coming in, like ScalaModules or IMP. I see synergies in those
cases.
I also see a better marketing for those projects by being associated under the
same banner. Right now I would qualify it is hard to find a project if you
don't know its name already, just by looking at the TLPs Eclipse advertises.

This bug is opened for community input. If you have any facts that go or
against this initiative, the council would like to hear them out.

Your opinion is important. Please let us know what you think.
