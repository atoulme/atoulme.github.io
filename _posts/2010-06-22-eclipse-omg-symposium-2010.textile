I was lucky to present at the Eclipse OMG symposium this year.

The <a href="http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/tc/mn/special-events/Eclipse.htm">agenda</a> of the symposium comprised of several sections: Assets and Models, Specification And Authoring, UML and Specification Conformance.

As part of the Specification Conformance session, I spoke about <a href="http://www.bpmn.org">BPMN 2.0</a> and our plans for the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/?project=bpmn2">Eclipse project</a>.

We have major contributions piling up, in particular from SAP. Reiner worked on the  final metamodel from the specification and provided the project with an ecore model. 

I am also seeing interest from both sides, Eclipse and OMG, to work on a test suite for BPMN 2.0. That's maybe the most exciting part of the new Revision Task Force !

Thanks again for the OMG to organize this event ! I was happy to meet in person with other members of the FTF. Looking forward to our next call.
