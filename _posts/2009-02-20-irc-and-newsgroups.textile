title: IRC and newsgroups

I just had this discussion with <a href="http://blog.hantsuki.org/">Rem<abbr title="or i, he doesn't mind">y</abbr> Suen</a>:

<pre>
rcjsuen: toulmean: It is certainly nice that newsgroups answers can be archived whereas IRC isn't.
toulmean: rcjsuen: well. We could archive the IRC discussions with echelog to some extent ?
rcjsuen: toulmean: In a way. I guess part of the issue is that newsgroups postings are generally better formulated than IRC chat logs.
toulmean: rcjsuen: well, yeah, but I prefer IRC because of the human touch.
rcjsuen: But well, it isn't something we can do anything about anyway.
toulmean: yeah. You know eventually we could add a command to KOS-MOS: remember last 5 exchanges with x, y, z
toulmean: and post those exchanges to the newsgroup
toulmean: rcjsuen: then KOS-MOS would send back the url to the message it posted
rcjsuen: I don't know about that.
toulmean: rcjsuen: so all the guys asking hard questions can ask them, then we push the questions to the newsgroup, so there is no overlap.
toulmean: rcjsuen: otherwise people ask once, two, thee times in different places. It's hard.
rcjsuen: Right.
toulmean: rcjsuen: just an idea, do what you want with it.
rcjsuen: toulmean: When I remember to (which I usually don't), I try to put the question in the FAQ when it's been asked a lot.
toulmean: rcjsuen: let's about it again later ? let's let it sink a bit.

What do you think ? A keeper ?
