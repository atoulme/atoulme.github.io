title: Where is my EPL ?
---

_I have been meaning to post that one for a long time, please pardon my dust._

I had an odd question from a STP user the other day:
"So", he said, "what license are you guys working with ?"
It sounded too obvious. Then he added that he had browsed the website without finding the license page.

Truth is, compared to the Apache websites who always have a direct link to the license, in Eclipse you have to browse for the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/">Legal Resources</a> to grab your copy of the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/epl-v10.php">EPL</a>.

So how about adding a link somewhere in the Phoenix template to send to our license ? If you think that is a good idea, please vote for <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=198975">Bug 198975 â€“ Add a link to the EPL</a>.
