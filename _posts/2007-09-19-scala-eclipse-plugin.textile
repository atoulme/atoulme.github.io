title: Scala Eclipse plugin
---

Scala is a Java based language that combines the best of Ruby with strong types.

Sean McDirmid just released a new beta version of the plugin.

It is available through an update site: http://lamp.epfl.ch/~mcdirmid/scala.update

Congratulations to Sean for this achievement ! I look forward to dive into Scala and help on this front.

The complete announcement is available <a href="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala">here</a>.
