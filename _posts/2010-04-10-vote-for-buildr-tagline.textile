title: Vote for Buildr tagline
---

We are seriously thinking of updating the Buildr tagline. 
We exchanged proposals over the mailing list in this <a href="http://buildr.markmail.org/thread/eribw7jxzt5ltxxb">thread</a>. 
If you'd like to vote on the tagline, the Doodle poll is <a href="http://doodle.com/ey6c6ne52radyeue">here</a>. 
You can vote for more than one proposal. 
My favorites are "lean builds", "Ready, Set, Build!" and "Build Like You Code".

Results soon!
