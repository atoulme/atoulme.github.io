p. I was puzzled to see this <a href="http://sob.apotheon.org/?p=351">post</a> from Chad showing up in my feeds reader with a nice underlined word, <abbr title"just like that">animated when mousing over it</abbr>.

<br/>

p. It so occurs that the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_acronym.asp">@acronym@</a> tag can be used to do that. No Javascript involved.
This might be an old trick, but it just works. Thanks Chad!



p. UPDATE: See the comments, use abbr instead.



p. UPDATE 2: See Chad's <a href="http://sob.apotheon.org/?p=352">post</a>: 

bq.    1. @<acronym>@: a tag that is supported by more browsers now, but may become obsolete in the future, judging by a proposed specification that may one day become a standard
   2. @<abbr>@: a tag that, right now, isn't supported properly by the browser with the single biggest share of the market â€” and, thus, the browser used by the most potential visitors or customers at your website
