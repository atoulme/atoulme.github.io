I just moved to <a href="http://kubuntu.org/">kubuntu Gutsy</a>.

It's very good. It was running well at the first boot, and the ATI drivers were activated in 3 clicks.

Overall (I'm moving from Dapper), the gain in performance and graphics is very noticeable. My computer has never been so silent and so fast.

There are still two small glitches:

I can't put my computer to hibernate. Well, it does hibernate, but I can't expect it to wake up.
Here is the <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.22/+bug/121653">Ubuntu bug</a> to watch.

Dolphin. I don't like it. I have gotten used to the unique features of Konqueror, the copy To action, the tab support.
