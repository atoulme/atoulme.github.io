title: Collect praise for your Eclipse project
---

At <a href="http://www.intalio.com">Intalio</a>, my company, we find very important to collect feedback at the end of trainings. From that feedback, we sometimes extract <a href="http://intalio.com/customers/quotes/">very nice quotes</a> from actual customers.

We pride ourselves with them and we display them on the website as a proof of our ability to deliver.

And of course, it helps people to trust our product.

So how about we do the same thing for our Eclipse projects ? I could imagine having a json array on the CVS website, from which I would randomly pick three quotes every time the home page is reloaded to place them on the right.

Thoughts ? Quotes ? Please comment on this <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=256664">bug</a>.
