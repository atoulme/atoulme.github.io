title: From BPMN to BPEL at EclipseCon
---

Last contribution to <a href="http://www.lunar-ocean.com/blog/presentations-at-eclipsecon-2007/">EclipseCon</a>, our <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&id=3887">talk on the transformation from BPMN to BPEL</a>. This is a direct peek at my everyday work.

Hugues did most of the job of preparing the talk and left me with the computation of a graph into a tree, which in itself is a good subject to talk about for hours.

We had the pleasure of hosting the STP lead too. <a href="http://blogs.iona.com/ohurley/">Oisin Hurley  </a> introduced beautifully our <a href="http://blogs.iona.com/ohurley/2007/03/eclipsecon_day_3_1.html">talk</a>.

The experience in itself was amazing, since more than 50 people showed up for the talk, including the GMF lead (thanks Rich !), and we had a few good questions.

I think I agree with Hugues that we stunned the audience - we went into hardcore details right from the beginning and stayed there. :)
