title: NLS and StringBuffer
---

I was surprised to find in the <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.4M4-200712131700/eclipse-news-M4.html">M4 News And Noteworthy</a> list a shortcut to change a concatenated @String@ to @StringBuffer@.

At first, it looks like a good idea.

<pre>String s = "offset " + offset + " is at line " + line;</pre>

is changed to:
<pre>
StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer();
stringBuffer.append("offset ");
stringBuffer.append(offset);
stringBuffer.append(" is at line ");
stringBuffer.append(line);
</pre>

_I know using StringBuffers is better for performance_ UPDATE: I confused StringBuffer with StringBuilder! look at this <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=213301">bug</a> for changing StringBuffer to StringBuilder.

I would have rather been going for this:

<pre>NLS.bind("offset {0} is at line {1}", offset, line);</pre>

Just because this is so much easier to internationalize.

I have almost finished doing i18n for the BPMN modeler, a component of the STP project, and I really lost time on such cases.

Just my $0.02!
