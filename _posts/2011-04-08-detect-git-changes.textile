title: Detect git changes
---

I recently had the need to detect changes in a git repository.
There really aren't good ways to do this without cloning the repository that I know of.

If you have a local clone, it is fairly easy. Here is a bash function that does the job by comparing the most recent commit on HEAD and the remote master.
It implies you work with the remote master branch, but that's easily changeable.
