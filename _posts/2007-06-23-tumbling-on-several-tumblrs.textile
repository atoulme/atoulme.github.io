title: Tumbling on several tumblrs
---

I really love Tumblr, and I love filling up my <a href="http://watchlog.lunar-ocean.com">watchlog</a>,

but it gets a bit messy when you have two Tumblr accounts: you never really know on which you are logged, and it becomes painful quickly.

So.. any firefox brilliant extension for that ? Or just a better bookmarklet from the guys ?
