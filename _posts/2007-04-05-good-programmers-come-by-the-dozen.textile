title: Good programmers come by the dozen

You just don't become a <a href="http://moishelettvin.blogspot.com/2007/01/less-programming-more-skill.html">good programmer through sheer force</a> :

bq. I didn't miss the long hours or the stress, but I missed being surrounded by lots of really smart people, and sitting down in front of a computer to just crank out code.

I start experiencing that too (meaning, being surrounded by smart people). Chad Fowler <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">wrote</a> it was like being the worst player of the band. Your skills are leveraged by the overall technical skills.

And we do have sometimes good discussions (when we don't talk about <a href="http://www.lunar-ocean.com/blog/maven-firefighter/">Maven</a>).
