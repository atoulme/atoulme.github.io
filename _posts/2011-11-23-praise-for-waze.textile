I never had heard of free apps of the kind before, so I installed it for a quick tour.

I was instantly blown away by the smart idea behind the app. It’s a multi-agent beast where all users report instantly the traffic conditions through their phones. They can either report explicitly or just by signaling their speed via the built-in “GPS” capabilities of the iPhone.

I didn’t catch as much the vibe of the community behind it, but it looks like there are contests and social experiences you can try out. I could potentially relate to other drivers stuck in traffic like me, or get prizes for using the app regularly.

An other smart thing ; you can report occurrences (accidents, traffic) by pressing big buttons. The minute you switch to a keyboard, the application will stop you if you are driving.
