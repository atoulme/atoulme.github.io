title: Intalio User Conference
---

I bring a message of love from my company, Intalio, to the Eclipse community.

Folks, if you want to know the in and outs of BPM, are interested into BPMN or dig BPEL, we have cool discounts for you at the <a href="http://intaliocon.com/">Intalio user conference</a>.

In particular, we will be addressing the <a href="http://intaliocon.com/sessions.php#2">extension capabilities of the BPMN modeler</a>, how to add a <a href="http://intaliocon.com/sessions.php#9">new form technology</a> to our Designer.

There will also be some very cool stuff about <a href="http://intaliocon.com/sessions.php#13">SOA</a>, including REST sessions (<a href="http://intaliocon.com/sessions.php#restfulbpm">here</a> and <a href="http://intaliocon.com/sessions.php#15">here</a>).

The conference is all about our users too, so they will have the opportunity to <a href="http://intaliocon.com/sessions.php#4">quizz us</a>, and get a live <a href="http://intaliocon.com/sessions.php#16">support session</a> with our <a href="http://onbpms.com">VP of support</a> himself.
