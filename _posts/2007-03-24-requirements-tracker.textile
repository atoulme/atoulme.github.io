title: Requirements Tracker

This is my first post over what is my most time consuming hobby, to the strong dismay of my wife, <a href="http://www.requirements-tracker.com">Requirements Tracker</a>.

This website offers the possibility to create requirements and manage their lifecycle. 

I just added a basic functionality to add a RSS feed by project. Hopefully this should be consolidated and extended to the requirements by next week.
