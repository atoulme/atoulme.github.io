title: "My first screencast: export a project in Eclipse"
---

I just created my first <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytqlBH6_nIk">screencast</a>. It is meant to help our users export their projects properly in an Eclipse environment.

The quality is not perfect, I will work on that for the next ones.

UPDATE: I have moved from embedding a single screencast to using a Youtube playlist. I have updated this page with the embedded playlist. Have fun!
