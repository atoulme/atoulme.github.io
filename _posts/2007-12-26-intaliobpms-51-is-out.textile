title: Intalio|BPMS 5.1 is out
---

I'm very happy to announce that we made a new release of Intalio|BPMS.

We have fixed bugs in this release, introduced a new tool named "Insert space" (it deserves a separate blog post that should come soon).

Overall the modeling experience is now even smoother.

We also upgraded Designer and Server to support java 6.

You can get all this new stuff for free right now on our <a href="http://bpms.intalio.com">community web site</a>.

Happy holidays!
