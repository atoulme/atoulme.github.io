title: RSSifying the Intalio community
---

I want to help the Intalio community by giving our users the possibility to broadcast their blog posts over a common RSS feed, and eventually a common UI, much like <a href="http://planeteclipse.org">planeteclipse.org</a> works.

Anyone against the name **planet.intalio.com** ? Please voice your opinions in the comments !
