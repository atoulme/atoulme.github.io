title: Graphical goodies for the BPMN modeler
---

We have worked hard on the BPMN modeler and have a few things to show off.


h3. Some semantic changes


<ul>
        <li>Associations can target sequence and messaging edges.</li>
At the semantic level only. We are actively working on making it possible to connect them in the diagram.
	<li>Pools hold messaging edges.</li>
We haven't worked on making it possible in the editor as well, but the semantic model accepts those now.
</ul>


h3. Support for BPMN 1.1


We are heading for basic support of BPMN 1.1. You can deactivate it in the BPMN Diagrams preference page.
<ul>
	<li><abbr title="How could we live without them ?">Signal events</abbr></li>
They really don't look good yet, and we are looking for help on <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=219070">that</a>

	<li>The look and feel of shapes is BPMN 1.1 compliant</li>

</ul>
<li><abbr title="A picture is worth a thousand words here.">Routing of sequence edges with gateways has drastically improved.</abbr></li>

h3. More


<ul>
	<li>We have added the link and multiple events to the palette.</li>
We miss images for those items right now, as well as the ones for the signal event. Working on that bit.
<li>Only one connection handle shows at a time in the diagram.</li>
We wanted to have only one connection handle showing at a time. That way when you mouse over the shapes, they don't animate all at the same time.
	<li>Terminate events are better centered</li>
<a href='http://www.lunar-ocean.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/better-centered-terminate-events.png' title='Better centered terminate end events'><img src='http://www.lunar-ocean.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/better-centered-terminate-events.png' alt='Better centered terminate end events' /></a>
<li>Improvements over lanes</li>
<a href='http://www.lunar-ocean.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/pools-with-colorful-lanes.png' title='Lanes'><img src='http://www.lunar-ocean.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/pools-with-colorful-lanes.thumbnail.png' alt='Lanes' /></a>
Lanes can now have a background color, and they resize in a better way that they used to.
	<li>We have fixed a <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=218761">pesky bug</a> when using the BPMN modeler in a different editing domain.</li>
</ul>

We hope you enjoy those improvements, will be inspired by them and will give us a hand at the next Eclipse bug day!
