title: CDT on IRC ?
---

<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/">CDT</a>, as in C Development Tools, is currently under represented on IRC, as in Internet Relay Chat.

We get a lot of questions about it on the <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/eclipse">#eclipse</a> channel on Freenode. Some people complain about content assist not working, some have more specific C questions, and so far it sounds like we can't help with them.

CDT committers, if you have some bandwidth left, please come down here, it's all fun and community gathering. 

If you don't have time, I understand.
