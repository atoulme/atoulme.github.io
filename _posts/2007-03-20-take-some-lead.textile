I stumbled into <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007/01/the_top_ten_stu.html">this</a> while browsing <a href="http://debbiemoynihan.com/?p=40">Debbie's</a> blog. It's true that you have less registrations if you ask for an e-mail address right away, but at least you have really motivated people on your website after that.
