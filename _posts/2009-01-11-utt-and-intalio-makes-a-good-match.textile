title: UTT and Intalio makes a good match
---

I just learnt today that a new intern from <a href="http://www.utt.fr">UTT, the University of Technology of Troyes</a>, would join <a href="http://www.intalio.com">us</a> in February!<img src="http://www.lunar-ocean.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/utt-logo.png" alt="utt-logo" title="utt-logo" width="217" height="82" class="alignright size-full wp-image-202" />

That makes him our third UTT intern, me being the <del datetime="2009-01-12T02:04:40+00:00">elder- first one. I am very glad people from my former school are appreciated here, and I will do my best to get more utetiens on board.
