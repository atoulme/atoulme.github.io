title: Get more, get BPMN 0.8!
---

Tonight with the release of STP M5, the BPMN modeler will come bundled with a pile of improvements.(see <a href="http://www.lunar-ocean.com/blog/graphical-goodies-for-the-bpmn-modeler/">last week post</a> to get the overview).

<ul>
<li>
Better group support
We have now a good support of groups. They add activities when resizing or moving, and activities update their groups when resizing and moving, or being created.
There seems that there are a few glitches on the popupbar edit policy, which tends to show at the center of the pool when Ctrl+Space is hit on top of a group.

</li>
<li>
Icons everywhere
Hugues added icons for the multiple events and the signal events. We have a very fancy collection of icons now. They do not all reflect the BPMN 1.1 style, we are working on that.
</li>
<li>
Complex gateway palette item
Just added, still hot from the compiler.

</li>

<li>
Throwing and catching shapes
In BPMN 1.1, the throwing or catching property is dictated by the messages on the event, or is user selected.

We added an action for the user to select that one, in case the event has no messages.

</li>

<li>
We have worked on adding support for TODO, XXX and FIXME tasks on text annotations.

Meaning you can take a text annotation, and write "TODO buy milk" in its label.
Automagically, a task marker will show on save and you will see the task in the Tasks view. The task supports the "Go To" action through the GMF goodness.

</li>
<li>
Message connections between pools
We have added a little menu item for the end connection menu, so that you can connect to the underlying pool.
Pool messages don't look good yet though: we have a specific framework to create anchors that was very specific to activities,
and we won't have cycles to work on that just now.
</li>
<li>
Pool message handles
Grab a pool handle and drag all you can, those handles will enable you to connect to an other pool or activity with a messaging edge.
</li>
<li>
Sequence edges and messaging edges support associations with artifacts
This seems to be a very stable new feature.
