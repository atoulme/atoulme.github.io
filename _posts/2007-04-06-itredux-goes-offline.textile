We had a special gift from Ismael the other day.

We were offered some very nice USB keys with the <a href="http://itredux.com">IT|Redux</a> logo !

The key comes with the Office suite of <a href="http://www.thinkfree.com">Think Free</a> installed, here is <a href="http://itredux.com/blog/2007/02/14/thinkfree-loves-you/">the full story</a>.

Thank you guys !
