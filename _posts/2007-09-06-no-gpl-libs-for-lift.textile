title: no GPL libs for lift
---

There is an interesting discussion going on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/liftweb/browse_thread/thread/1b1e48d7309f22d?hl=en">lift mailing list</a>.

The principal maintainer, David Pollak, doesn't want to abide by the FSF and add GPL or LGPL code to his code base.

Well, I kinda agree.

In terms of freedom, having to redistribute your source code when using one of those libraries is actually reducing your freedom.

Maybe the ultimate DRM ?
