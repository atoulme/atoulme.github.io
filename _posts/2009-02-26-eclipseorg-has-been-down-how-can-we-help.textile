title: Eclipse.org has been down ; how can we help ?
---

Our webmasters are having a rough time, the downloads area is down because there were recent issues with mirrors. All my sympathy goes to them.

I think we can help. I filed <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=266380">266380</a> today:

bq. 
Would it be feasible that we make I-builds and N-builds, that are most of the
time only available on the Canada website, to be available as torrents ?

People would help each other downloading them and depend a bit less on the
server.

I myself would be happy to set a high ratio on such torrents.


I think we could have a script to create torrent files in the same way we have a script to push files to mirrors. I welcome your feedback, and I hope we can all help eclipse.org stay up soon.
